## What's New

2. Lsec Drawing production is now improved to maintain consistent scaling for schedule plots, regardless of the length of the canal. Note: A standard production length of 1000m is assumed.

    Previously, any reach less than a 1000m is generated with odd text height, spacing, and scaling, creating too much modification work to drafts persons.

2. Batch cross-section generation is succesully improved to correct the issue of duplicate plot titles exported to AutocAD.

    Additionally, we recomend the use of OVERKILL command in AutoCAD, to swiftly handle duplicate objects in a drawing.
